[Sincerely Inc.](https://Sincerely.com) recently hosted our first Make-a-Thon.
Similar in nature to a hack-a-thon, except that we wanted to make sure everyone 
in the company could participate.

Each team had the opportunity to discuss ideas before the event, and we officially
kicked off the event on Thursday at noon.  JJ Ford and myself teamed up, along with 
Zain Ali for some kick ass design work.

At Sincerely our mission is to make the world more thoughtful, and our 
philosophy is to make informed data-driven decisions. So, we decided to 
build an analytics engine around the thoughtfulness of our customers and 
the world.

JJ and I chose to create the project in Rails for fast prototyping.

As the project began I started building a network interface for Sincerely's 
internal api and he discovered a quality JS liquid animation for our first graphic.
