Myself and a few coworkers set out one weekend to the lumber yard.  Our goal? To awesome-ify our office.  Specifically, we set out to turn this post (to the left) into a rock climbing wall.

<!-- more -->

Now as it turned out, the concrete posts are actually in place to surround the support beam inside.  The concrete itself is very weak and is crumbling in various places.  So it wouldn't suffice to drill any concrete screws and expect them to support the load.

So (with my limited construction experience) I sketched out some plans to construct a wood frame tightly around the 
beam in it's entirety.

The wall is designed to be supported only by frame itself, and is not anchored to the beam in any way.  The main concern here was that the frame could move when weighted. 


Fortunately we measured twice and cut once, the frame wrapped tightly around the support beam and is amazingly stable (even with 2 or 3 of us climbing at once).  

The plans weren't perfect however, I made a calculation typo in the measurements of the plywood walls leaving a slight gap on one side of the pillar.  After a few paint touch ups the mistake is hardly noticeable and even provides another feature to use for certain climbing routes.

I recruited some friends to help along with a coworker, the famous Doc Pop.  While he and I drilled & assembled the frame, the girls prepared the panels.  They started by mixing some fine grained sand with the black paint we had chosen and adding several coats.  The texture worked out amazingly strong, clean and featured.

Then they marked up the back of the panels with locations for our predrilled hold placement options.

Doc drilled away at the back of the painted walls and then the finale.  We screwed all of the panels into the frame and wallah!  We had a climbing wall.... sans holds.


Placing the holds was of course the most exciting part... and the moment of truth ... standing on wall for the first time.  The climbing holds bolted in nicely and didn't budge when weighted.  Success.
