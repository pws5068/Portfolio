I wanted to try something a little different for Halloween this year, 
and I've certainly been looking to get my hands dirty with more arduino hacking projects.  

Of course, I'm not the first person to consider hacking a pumpkin so I took to 
the internet for some inspiration.

<!-- more -->

The most intriguing project I came across was a [pumpkin armed with silly string and a motion sensor](http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-controlled-Silly-String-shooter/),
but given the limited time on hand and dwindling inventory at the local radio shack I 
needed to come up with something different.

Radio Shack did have one item in particular that caught my interest, a [102dB Piezo Alarm](http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2062405).  

That should suffice to scare the pants off any unsuspecting guests.  Using some google-fu I
managed to find a person who had made a DIY from a very similar project .. [except that he used a car horn](http://blog.makezine.com/2012/10/26/make-the-scariest-pumpkin-ever/).  I suspect my neighbors would 
not approve.

So I started wiring up the components available.

But, the problem remained .. with no motion sensor how could I hide conspicuously trigger 
the alarm? Easy. By selecting a button as large and irresistable as possible :)
