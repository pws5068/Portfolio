    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Ready to scratch those cams?&#8221; Eric asked out of the blue. I wasn&#8217;t sure exactly what he had in mind.. but after a few dozen expeditions with the guy I&#8217;ve learned to simply answer, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Apparently, Eric had his sights set on the classic Cathedral Peak of Yosemite.</p>

<p>To this point, I had followed him on a multi-pitch once. I had led two local outdoors sport routes .. each in the ballpark of 25-30 feet high. <!-- more --> But Cathedral Peak? That&#8217;s over 800 feet. Sure, from the grade perspective a 5.7 crux sounded perfectly reasonable.. but damn.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://paulsilvis.com/images/posts/pages/climbing/cathedral_peak/cathedral_west.jpg" width="300" title="Cathedral Peak from the West" ></p>

<p>A few days later we embarked with two other friends (Andrew and Daniel) to Yosemite. Eric and I had met Andrew on our bouldering trip to Bishop a few months back; Daniel and I had met briefly on a Castle Rock day trip.</p>

<p>Originally the three of us planned to stealth camp in Tuolumne meadows, but when we arrived late Friday night we decided to drop our gear in any open campsite. The temperature fell to the 30&#8217;s but we agreed to leave our tents to save time in the morning.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://paulsilvis.com/images/posts/pages/climbing/cathedral_peak/campsite.jpg" width="450" title="Campsite" ></p>

<p>After 6 hours of sleep, we piled into the car. Once at the trailhead we emptied our packs and racked our gear &#8211; then began our hike to the crag. The path ascended on a gradual incline with Cathedral Peak towering over the trees in the distance.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://paulsilvis.com/images/posts/pages/climbing/cathedral_peak/sorting_gear.jpg" width="450" title="Racking Climbing Gear" ></p>

<p>We arrived at the base around 10am.. and we were surrounded by other climbing teams (and marmots).</p>

<p>Regardless, we found a clear section and prepared for our first pitch. Eric would lead trad and Daniel would follow. Daniel left Eric&#8217;s protection in the wall as he ascended. As the third climber I would then lead using his placements. After each pitch I would belay for Andrew while Eric started the next pitch.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://paulsilvis.com/images/posts/pages/climbing/cathedral_peak/eric_base.jpg" width="450" title="Getting ready to climb" ></p>

<p>The first pitch was very short with a gradual incline. Eric climbed then built us an anchor, and we regrouped on the first belay station. We were still finding our groove at this point and fumbled with gear for a while before starting up the second pitch.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://paulsilvis.com/images/posts/pages/climbing/cathedral_peak/daniel_first_pitch.jpg" width="450" title="First pitch" ></p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://paulsilvis.com/images/posts/pages/climbing/cathedral_peak/paul_first_pitch.jpg" width="450" title="First pitch" ></p>

<p>The second pitch was equally short but more vertical. From there we found our rhythm and started catching up to the parties above. Unfortuantely, we would be doing a lot of waiting from then on.</p>

<p>We reached a stand-still on the third pitch for an hour or more. The wind picked up and the temperature dropped.</p>

<p>The fourth pitch was equally long and Andrew was stuck waiting alone on a small ledge below. Fortunately for all of us, the spectacular views made the wait managable despite the cold.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://paulsilvis.com/images/posts/pages/climbing/cathedral_peak/andrew_pitch_3.jpg" width="450" title="Third Pitch" ></p>

<p>The climbing was graceful but at times the holds were small and knobby. There were definitely a few points where I was looking 15&#8217; down to my last clip and envisioning a rough whipper if I were to slip.</p>

<p>By the time we reached the famous chimney, we were all freezing and wondering if a summit was still in reach. All of the parties below us bailed, and this  was our last chance to escape if we wanted to throw in the towel. After a group discussion we decided to push forward. We had been on the wall for 9 hours now and fleeting daylight became a concern.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://paulsilvis.com/images/posts/pages/climbing/cathedral_peak/chimney.jpg" width="450" title="Chimney" ></p>

<p>At the top of the chimney the altitude (11k&#8217;) combined with lack of food &amp; water finally caught up with me. I became nauseous and started to question my ability to keep pushing forward. Fortunately (now), I didn&#8217;t have a choice. The bottleneck above us cleared out and we climbed the last two pitches.</p>

<p>The views from the summit were unreal. I didn&#8217;t take many pictures and they wouldn&#8217;t do it justice. Eric always gets emotional around extrodinary scenery; this time I shared his sentiment. My symptoms faded as I absorbed our surroundings.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://paulsilvis.com/images/posts/pages/climbing/cathedral_peak/eric_summit.jpg" width="450" title="Summit" ></p>

<p>I looked down at my cams in approval. Beautifully scratched.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://Sincerely.com">Sincerely Inc.</a> recently hosted our first Make-a-Thon.
Similar in nature to a hack-a-thon, except that we wanted to make sure everyone
in the company could participate.</p>

<p>Each team had the opportunity to discuss ideas before the event, and we officially
kicked off the event on Thursday at noon.  JJ Ford and myself teamed up, along with
Zain Ali for some kick ass design work.</p>

<p>At Sincerely our mission is to make the world more thoughtful, and our
philosophy is to make informed data-driven decisions. So, we decided to
build an analytics engine around the thoughtfulness of our customers and
the world.</p>

<p>JJ and I chose to create the project in Rails for fast prototyping.</p>

<p>As the project began I started building a network interface for Sincerely&#8217;s
internal api and he reverse engineered a JS liquid animation from the wild.</p>

<p>On the live page, the gears above are turning and the thoughtful-juices are flowing..
but you&#8217;ll just have to use your imagination ;-)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to try something a little different for Halloween this year,
and I&#8217;ve been looking to get my hands dirty with more arduino hacking projects.</p>

<p>Of course, I&#8217;m not the first person to consider hacking a pumpkin so I took to
the internet for some inspiration.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="left" src="http://paulsilvis.com/images/posts/pages/hacks/arduino_hacking/lcd_shield_testing.jpg" width="280"></p>

<p>The most intriguing project I came across was a <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-controlled-Silly-String-shooter/">pumpkin armed with silly string and a motion sensor</a>,
but given the limited time on hand and dwindling inventory at the local radio shack I
needed to come up with something different.</p>

<p>Radio Shack did have one item in particular that caught my interest, a <a href="http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2062405">102dB Piezo Alarm</a>.</p>

<p>That should suffice to scare the pants off any unsuspecting guests.  Using some google-fu I
managed to find a person who had made a DIY from a very similar project .. <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/2012/10/26/make-the-scariest-pumpkin-ever/">except that he used a car horn</a>.  I suspect my neighbors would
not approve.</p>

<p>So I started wiring up the components available.</p>

<p><img src="http://paulsilvis.com/images/posts/pages/hacks/arduino_hacking/arduino_breadboard.jpg" width="450"></p>

<p>But, the problem remained .. with no motion sensor how could I hide conspicuously trigger
the alarm? Easy. By selecting a button as large and irresistable as possible :)</p>

<p><img src="http://paulsilvis.com/images/posts/pages/hacks/arduino_hacking/finished_hack_o_lantern.jpg" width="450"></p>

<p>The photo above was taken from the entrance to the Sincerely Halloween Party&#8217;s haunted
maze.  I used a portable battery pack to power the Arduino &amp; let it loose.</p>

<p>LEDs in the button glowed with temptation &amp; any time someone entering fell for the trap
everyone at the event in the got a good laugh.  The sketch was pretty simple:</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Sincerely Office Climbing Wall]]></title>
    <link href="http://paulsilvis.com/blog/2012/10/24/office-climbing-wall/"/>
    <updated>2012-10-24T22:16:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://paulsilvis.com/blog/2012/10/24/office-climbing-wall</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One late evening at the office, myself and a few coworkers realized our office was definitely missing
something. But what?  We had a kitchen, a developer room, fantastic views and great culture. Of course,
when we put our minds to it the answer was so clear &#8211; a rock climbing wall.</p>

<p>So, on a whim I found a tape measure and sketched up some plans for the new addition.  We decided
to turn the post shown below into our wall.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://paulsilvis.com/images/posts/pages/hacks/office_climbing_wall/original_pillar.jpg" width="250" title="Halfway Done" ></p>

<p>Now as it turned out, the concrete posts are actually in place to wrap the support beam inside. <!-- more --> The concrete itself is very weak and is crumbling.  It wouldn&#8217;t suffice to drill any concrete screws and expect them to support the load.  Instead, we decided to construct a frame around the pillar.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://paulsilvis.com/images/posts/pages/hacks/office_climbing_wall/construction_plan.png" width="450" title="Rough Construction Plan" ></p>

<p>The wall is designed to be supported only by frame itself, and is not anchored to the beam in any way.  The main concern here was that the frame could move when weighted.</p>

<p>I recruited some friends to help along with a coworker, the famous Doc Pop.  While he and I drilled &amp; assembled the frame, the our friends prepared the panels.  They started by mixing some fine grained sand with the black paint we had chosen and adding several coats.  The texture worked out amazingly strong, clean and featured.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://paulsilvis.com/images/posts/pages/hacks/office_climbing_wall/freshly_painted.jpg" width="350">
<img src="http://paulsilvis.com/images/posts/pages/hacks/office_climbing_wall/doc_drilling.jpg" width="300" height="300">
<img src="http://paulsilvis.com/images/posts/pages/hacks/office_climbing_wall/inc_climbing_wall_halfway.jpg" width="300" title="Halfway Done" ></p>

<p>Then they marked up the back of the panels with locations for our predrilled hold placement options.</p>

<p>Doc drilled away at the back of the painted walls and then the finale.  We screwed all of the panels into the frame and wallah!  We had a climbing wall&#8230;. sans holds.</p>

<p>Placing the holds was of course the most exciting part&#8230; and the moment of truth &#8230; standing on wall for the first time.  The climbing holds bolted in nicely and didn&#8217;t budge when weighted.  Success.</p>

<p>The plans weren&#8217;t perfect however, I made a calculation typo in the measurements of the plywood walls leaving a slight gap on one side of the pillar.  After a few paint touch ups the mistake is hardly noticeable and even provides another crack-like feature to use for certain climbing routes.</p>
