<h2>Life Outside</h2>
<p>
	Throughout my life, I've been driven to test myself and discover my own personal limits.  I believe in taking chances, and calculated risks to find out what's possible.
</p>

<h2>Climbing</h2>
<p>
	Over the past few years, I've developed a great respect for climbing and dedication to improve my ability.  During this time I've climbed both indoors and out, from the Shawangunks in New Paltz, NY to Stinson Beach in California.

<h2>Snowboarding</h2>
<p>
	Around age 10, I decided to put down my skis and try my luck on a snowboard.  After a few painful days of learning, I've been absolutely hooked. Since then, I've taken snowboarding trips all across the West Coast and in Canada.

<h2>Variety</h2>
<p>
	 My philosophy has always been that if something scares you -- you should do it.  I've always been afraid of heights, for example and still they make me uncomfortable.  That fear, is exactly what keeps me moving up the climbing wall and it's what drove me to try Sky Diving.
