<h3>SpeedCountry Mobile</h3>

<p>SpeedCountry Mobile is an on-going project. For now, it's on the back-burner.</p>

<p>The <a href="/web/speedcountry">SpeedCountry project</a> is primarily a web-based app which was co-designed with <a href="http://www.MikeSilvis.com">Mike Silvis</a>, an extremely talented designer/developer.  As a side project however myself and a skilled developer from Penn State, Tommy Pantano, created the foundation for an iphone-based medium.</p>

<h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
<p>Working with Tommy on the SpeedCountry mobile app was an excellent learning experience.  It was my first chance to tie together my interests in web &amp; mobile development skill-sets.  I utilized the existing structure of SpeedCountry.com to securely output highly-condensed JSON data to be parsed and relayed back to the user.</p>

<h3>Availability</h3>
<p>As mentioned, this project has become a low priority and it will probably stay dormant for a while.  The motorist community is still very alive and available for you to check out at <a href="http://www.speedcountry.com/">SpeedCountry.com</a> and on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/speedcountry">twitter</a>.</p>
