<h3>Lonely Planet Postcards for Iphone</h3>

<p>The goal of this project was to combine the power of the <a href="http://dev.sincerely.com/">Sincerely Ship SDK</a> with the reputable brand of Lonely Planet.  Travel pictures and postcards are a perfect match for both audiences.  Additionally, Lonely Planet wanted to give their users the ability to select from a variety of pre-made postcards.</p>
