<h3>Technology Entrepreneurship</h3>
<p>Penn State's ENGR407 is a blend of technology innovation coupled with business planning and development. The goal of this class is to spark creativity and bring out the leader in all of us.</p>

<p>From the first day of class, I knew this course would challenge my presentation and creativity skills far beyond any other class at Penn State. Along with a group of 4 other students, I was asked to scour the halls of Hammond Building for a person willing to give a presentation to my class. We approached several individuals and asked them to stand up in-front of our class (of 50 students) to talk about entrepreneurship and leadership. The first few people we asked laughed and then awkwardly paused when they realized we were serious. Sure enough, we were able to find a willing candidate before the class was over. We proudly brought him back to our class and had him present his views and opportunities to the group. This project forced myself and my group to open up to strangers and to sell an idea.</p>

<h3>Junkyard Wars</h3>
<p>Our second project demonstrated the potential value creation from seemingly worthless items. Each student in the class contributed several pieces of unwanted junk and then we were divided into teams. As a team, we chose the items we found interesting and then began to brainstorm. My team quickly reached a consensus and decided that we should build a weather resistant means to travel through densely populated areas. We then built our prototype and deemed it, WeatherWheels.</p>


<h3>Crash and Burn</h3>
<p>The title of this project is very representative of the work involved. The rules here are simple, make as much money as possible .. in 3 weeks. Our first project was selling live Goldfish for Valentines Day, with a tag that reads "You're the only fish in my sea." So far, we have sold 24 goldfish ~$5 each at only $.15 cost -- raising approximately $80.</p>

<p>Our second project was a "Speed Dating" session for Valentines Day. Soon there after, we began our most effective fund raising campaign. Our group conducted surveys of approximately 200 Penn State Students regarding the Best Places to Eat in State College (organized by categories such as "Best Burgers"). The winning companies were contacted and offered advertising space on our "Best of State College" flyer. We saw this idea as a great success and raised $725.</p>

<p>To top it off we designed and sold custom sunglasses for a Penn State event raising approximately $700. In the final stretch of the project we ran a second flyer for the best (non-food) places of state college similar to the original. After all was said and done, my team was proud to tally up the numbers for a total of $1700 in profit.</p>
