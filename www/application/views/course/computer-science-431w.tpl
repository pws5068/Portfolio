<h3>Databases</h3>
<p>During the past few years I've prototyped, implemented, and administrated a large number of databases. Despite the experience however, Computer Science 431W is my first formal training on the subject. With the help of a small team, I have developed an online store for Rock Climbing enthusiasts.</p>

<h3>Rock Sport Nation</h3>
<p>Rock Sport Nation is an interactive (theoretical) store for climbing enthusiasts. We designed our platform using an elegant combination of PHP, MySQL, Smarty, jQuery and other modern technologies.</p>

<h3>Availability</h3>
<p>The site is online now at <a href="http://www.rsncorp.com">RSNCorp.com</a>;although we don't actually accept orders.  With the proper suppliers, RSNCorp could flip a switch and go live tomorrow.</p>
