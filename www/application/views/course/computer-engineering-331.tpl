<h3>Digital Systems</h3>
<p>The contents of Computer Engineering 331 were split into two halves, with the first focusing on assembly programming. During the first half of the semester, I was taught to deeply understand MIPS Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). Several assignments were given, including one to recursively traverse a string and print it’s mirror using the stack register.</p>

<p>The second half of the course taught the use of the hardware descriptive language, known as VHDL. Using VHDL, I wrote simulations of several low-level hardware structures such as the 32 bit ripple carry adder and even an entire datapath simulator.  This course was intensive but highly informative and necessary for any programmer to truly understand the complexities of the underlying hardware.</p>
