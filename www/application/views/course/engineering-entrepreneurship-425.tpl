<h3>Project 1:</h3>

<p></p>
<p>The goal of this project was to create value from scratch.  Our team was handed a rubber band and vaguely instructed to use it to create value.  Our group took to the streets, and started trading.  After all was said and done, we had performed over 10 trades with complete strangers and the class voted our group's idea as the winner.
