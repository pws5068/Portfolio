<a href="http://www.Sincerely.com">Sincerely Inc.</a> is a tech startup company in San Francisco, CA.  Our goal is to make it easier to print and ship photos in the mail from your mobile devices.  I was hired by Sincerely for an internship in May 2011, and I was changed to full time in July.

<h2>Experience</h2>
<p>
	As one would expect with a startup, I've played several roles while I've worked at Sincerely. I have developed iOS applications such as <a href="/iphone/storyboarder">Storyboarder</a> and <a href="/iphone/lonely_planet_postcards">Lonely Planet Postcards</a>.  I have also done customer-facing website development and plenty of server-side programming as well.</a>
