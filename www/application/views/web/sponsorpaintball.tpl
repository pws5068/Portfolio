<h2>SponsorPaintball</h2>
<p>
	SponsorPaintball.com was my first production PHP project; the original design was created in 2007.  My platform creates an intuitive interface for new paintball teams to apply for sponsorships.  The registering teams simply fill out one application and a few dozen sponsorship applications are automatically submitted to participating companies.  The service saves both companies and teams time by submitting qualified teams to the right programs.  To date, SponsorPaintball.com had over 3,000 teams enrolled with new teams joining every day.

<h2>Current Status</h2>
<p>
	As of 10/16, SponsorPaintball.com has been taken down from production pending updates.  I plan to rebuild the community from the ground up using Code Igniter and more sustainable design principles.  Also, I plan to integrate better tracking &amp; analysis for the numbers of sponsorships that are granted and which criteria makes new teams more likely to succeed.  This data will be packaged and presented to registering teams for education to steer them in the right direction.
