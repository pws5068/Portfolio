<h2>SWPA Landlords</h2>
<p>
	The South-Western PA Landlords Association needed a dynamic tenant management portal capable of archiving their tenant relationships, documentation, and a scalable database of rental history. &nbsp; I completed this project and presented the final product in front of the board of directors and members for final approval.
