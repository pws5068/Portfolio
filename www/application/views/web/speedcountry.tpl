<h2>PHP-Driven Motorist Community</h2>
<p>
SpeedCountry is a joint effort between <a href="http://www.mikesilvis.com">Michael Silvis</a> and myself. Our vision is to create a social networking platform for vehicle enthusiasts from all backgrounds.

Our customers are enthusiasts; interested in sharing their on-road and off road vehicles with fellow motorists.  We care greatly about the overall user-experience that our platform can provide.  The goal is simple; encourage networking among similar interest users.
</p>
<h2>Dashboard:</h2>
<p>
Upon logging in, users are taken directly to their SpeedCountry dashboard.  Here they will see an updated news feed similar to those found in other Social Networking Platforms.  All events are shown which share a relation to their friends or their friends' vehicles.
</p>


<h2>Lobby / Garage:</h2>
<p>
Each registered user has instant access to their own virtual garage which is displayed publicly in their Lobby.  Here you can add in vehicles of all types; including Cars, Trucks, SUVs, Street Bikes, ATVs, Dirt Bikes, Snow Mobiles, Jet Skis -- you name it.  Each vehicle creates it's own profile page accessible from the user's Lobby.  These profile pages showcase pictures, stats, and a short description of the vehicle.  Additionally, comments may be left directly for any vehicle.
</p>


<h2>Clubs / Events:</h2>
<p>
Organize your public or private enthusiast club roster, events, and media all in one place.  With SpeedCountry, you can gain some serious publicity by attracting the right audience.  Soon you'll be able to set criteria for your club's exact location and interest criteria then our platform will do the advertising for you.  Want to attract only Nissan owners in your area for a local car exhibit? No problem.
