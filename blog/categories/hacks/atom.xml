    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to try something a little different for Halloween this year,
and I've been looking to get my hands dirty with more arduino hacking projects.</p>

<p>Of course, I'm not the first person to consider hacking a pumpkin so I took to
the internet for some inspiration.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="left" src="/images/posts/pages/hacks/arduino_hacking/lcd_shield_testing.jpg" width="280"></p>

<p>The most intriguing project I came across was a <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-controlled-Silly-String-shooter/">pumpkin armed with silly string and a motion sensor</a>,
but given the limited time on hand and dwindling inventory at the local radio shack I
needed to come up with something different.</p>

<p>Radio Shack did have one item in particular that caught my interest, a <a href="http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2062405">102dB Piezo Alarm</a>.</p>

<p>That should suffice to scare the pants off any unsuspecting guests.  Using some google-fu I
managed to find a person who had made a DIY from a very similar project .. <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/2012/10/26/make-the-scariest-pumpkin-ever/">except that he used a car horn</a>.  I suspect my neighbors would
not approve.</p>

<p>So I started wiring up the components available.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/pages/hacks/arduino_hacking/arduino_breadboard.jpg" width="450"></p>

<p>But, the problem remained .. with no motion sensor how could I hide conspicuously trigger
the alarm? Easy. By selecting a button as large and irresistable as possible :)</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/pages/hacks/arduino_hacking/finished_hack_o_lantern.jpg" width="450"></p>

<p>The photo above was taken from the entrance to the Sincerely Halloween Party's haunted
maze.  I used a portable battery pack to power the Arduino &amp; let it loose.</p>

<p>LEDs in the button glowed with temptation &amp; any time someone entering fell for the trap
everyone at the event in the got a good laugh.  The sketch was pretty simple:</p>

<p>```c</p>

<pre><code>#define R_LED 5 //The pin # of the red LED
#define Y_LED 6 // The pin # of the Yellow LED
#define SPEAKER 3 //The pin # of the speaker
#define BUTTON 7 //The pin # of the button

int i = 0;
int state = 0; //The on/off state of our siren.

void setup()
{
  pinMode(R_LED, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(Y_LED, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(SPEAKER, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(BUTTON, INPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600); 
}

void loop()
{
  //Save the buttons state
  state = digitalRead(BUTTON);

  //If the siren is on...
  if (state == 1)
  {
    Serial.println("STATE = 1");

    //Flash LED and Speaker on and off.
    for(i = 1; i &lt;= 2; i++)
    {
      analogWrite(Y_LED, 0);
      analogWrite(R_LED, 255);
      analogWrite(SPEAKER, 0);
      delay(50);
      analogWrite(Y_LED, 255);
      delay(50);
      analogWrite(R_LED, 0);
      analogWrite(Y_LED, 255);
      analogWrite(SPEAKER, 0);
      delay(400);
    }
  }
  else {
    //Turn of the speaker
    analogWrite(SPEAKER, 0);
    //Turn of the LED
    analogWrite(R_LED, 0);
    analogWrite(Y_LED, 0);
  }
}
</code></pre>

    <id>http://paulsilvis.com/blog/2012/10/24/office-climbing-wall</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One late evening at the office, myself and a few coworkers realized our office was definitely missing
something. But what?  We had a kitchen, a developer room, fantastic views and great culture. Of course,
when we put our minds to it the answer was so clear -- a rock climbing wall.</p>

<p>So, on a whim I found a tape measure and sketched up some plans for the new addition.  We decided
to turn the post shown below into our wall.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/posts/pages/hacks/office_climbing_wall/original_pillar.jpg" width="250" title="Halfway Done" ></p>

<p>Now as it turned out, the concrete posts are actually in place to wrap the support beam inside. <!-- more --> The concrete itself is very weak and is crumbling.  It wouldn't suffice to drill any concrete screws and expect them to support the load.  Instead, we decided to construct a frame around the pillar.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/posts/pages/hacks/office_climbing_wall/construction_plan.png" width="450" title="Rough Construction Plan" ></p>

<p>The wall is designed to be supported only by frame itself, and is not anchored to the beam in any way.  The main concern here was that the frame could move when weighted.</p>

<p>I recruited some friends to help along with a coworker, the famous Doc Pop.  While he and I drilled &amp; assembled the frame, the our friends prepared the panels.  They started by mixing some fine grained sand with the black paint we had chosen and adding several coats.  The texture worked out amazingly strong, clean and featured.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/posts/pages/hacks/office_climbing_wall/freshly_painted.jpg" width="350">
<img src="/images/posts/pages/hacks/office_climbing_wall/doc_drilling.jpg" width="300" height="300">
<img src="/images/posts/pages/hacks/office_climbing_wall/inc_climbing_wall_halfway.jpg" width="300" title="Halfway Done" ></p>

<p>Then they marked up the back of the panels with locations for our predrilled hold placement options.</p>

<p>Doc drilled away at the back of the painted walls and then the finale.  We screwed all of the panels into the frame and wallah!  We had a climbing wall.... sans holds.</p>

<p>Placing the holds was of course the most exciting part... and the moment of truth ... standing on wall for the first time.  The climbing holds bolted in nicely and didn't budge when weighted.  Success.</p>

<p>The plans weren't perfect however, I made a calculation typo in the measurements of the plywood walls leaving a slight gap on one side of the pillar.  After a few paint touch ups the mistake is hardly noticeable and even provides another crack-like feature to use for certain climbing routes.</p>
