    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>"Ready to scratch those cams?" Eric asked out of the blue. I wasn't sure exactly what he had in mind.. but after a few dozen expeditions with the guy I've learned to simply answer, "Yes."<!-- more --></p>

<p>Apparently, Eric had his sights set on the classic Cathedral Peak of Yosemite.</p>

<p>To this point, I had followed him on a multi-pitch once. I had led two local outdoors sport routes .. each in the ballpark of 25-30 feet high. But Cathedral Peak? That's over 800 feet. Sure, from the grade perspective a 5.7 crux sounded perfectly reasonable.. but damn.</p>

<p>A few days later we embarked with two other friends (Andrew and Daniel) to Yosemite. Eric and I had met Andrew on our bouldering trip to Bishop a few months back; Daniel and I had met briefly on a Castle Rock day trip.</p>

<p>Originally the three of us planned to stealth camp in Tuolumne meadows, but when we arrived late Friday night we decided to drop our gear in any open campsite. The temperature fell to the 30's but we ditched our tents to save time in the morning.</p>

<p>After 6 hours of sleep, we piled into the car. Once at the trailhead we emptied our packs and racked our gear -- then began our hike to the crag. The path ascended on a gradual incline with Cathedral Peak towering over the trees in the distance.</p>

<p>We arrived at the base around 10am.. and we were surrounded by other climbing teams (and marmots).</p>

<p>Regardless, we found a clear section and prepared for our first pitch. Eric would lead trad and Daniel would follow. Daniel left Eric's protection in the wall as he ascended. As the third climber I would then lead using his placements. After each pitch I would belay for Andrew while Eric started the next pitch.</p>

<p>The first pitch was very short with a gradual incline. Eric climbed then built us an anchor, and we regrouped on the first belay station. We were still finding our groove at this point and fumbled with gear for a while before starting up the second pitch.</p>

<p>The second pitch was equally short but more vertical. From there we found our rhythm and started catching up to the parties above. Unfortuantely, we would be doing a lot of waiting from then on.</p>

<p>We reached a stand-still on the third pitch for an hour or more. The wind picked up and the temperature dropped.</p>

<p>The fourth pitch was equally long and Andrew was stuck waiting alone on a small ledge below. Fortunately for all of us, the spectacular views made the wait managable despite the cold.</p>

<p>The climbing was graceful but at times the holds were small and knobby. There were definitely a few points where I was looking 15' down to my last clip and envisioning a rough whipper if I were to slip.</p>

<p>By the time we reached the famous chimney, we were all freezing and wondering if a summit was still in reach. All of the parties below us bailed, and this  was our last chance to escape if we wanted to throw in the towel. After a group discussion we decided to push forward. We had been on the wall for 9 hours now and fleeting daylight became a concern.</p>

<p>At the top of the chimney the altitude (11k') combined with lack of food &amp; water finally caught up with me. I became nauseous and started to question my ability to keep pushing forward. Fortunately (now), I didn't have a choice. The bottleneck above us cleared out and we climbed the last two pitches.</p>

<p>The views from the summit were unreal. I didn't take many pictures and they wouldn't do it justice. Eric always gets emotional around extrodinary scenery; this time I shared his sentiment. My symptoms faded as I absorbed our surroundings.</p>

<p>I looked down at my cams in approval. Beautifully scratched.</p>
